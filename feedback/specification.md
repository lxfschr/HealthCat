Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)

Looks good, but we were looking for a list of development task rather than a feature list. A couple of your items were focused more on the user workflow rather than the development aspect.

### Data Models (10/10)

Looks good overall.

You seem to have duplicate attributes called activity in your PetStats model, even though one of them is supposed to represent gender.

Is there a reason breed is represented as a foreign key in PetStats? Will there eventually be another model Breed?

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (10/10)

Nice mockup, the interactive mockup was pretty nice and provided a good idea of how your site will look and function.

### Sprint 1 Planning (0/10)

The sprint PDF was the same as the product backlog, if this was some kind of error email me.
