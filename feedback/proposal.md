### Eliot
This definitely seems like an interesting project, however it is important to keep in mind that we will be evaluating the web application primarily. It is easy to get caught up with hardware or networking errors which could potentially detract the time spent on your application. Are the extended features reach goals? It seems just the core features may not be a large enough of a project, it would be nice to see a couple of the extended features implemented. 

### Salem
Your app is probably one of the more unique I've seen so far. A small word of caution; if you've never prototyped with hardware before, it may be something worth doing some research into. I'd also recommend looking into Electric Imp (https://electricimp.com/) which is super good for prototyping wireless devices. As long as one or both of you have some amount of ECE or hardware prototyping experience, this sounds like it's doable. 

### Shannon
A super unique idea. I would suggest perhaps some interesting visualizations to go with the pet information data. For a task like that I would recommend JavaScript libraries like d3.js or nvd3.js for the creation of such charts.
